Group Contract
Ground rules that you believe will benefit your group and help you function better: 
1. Communicate regularly and effectively 
   1. Asking for help when you first need it
   2. Any personal emergencies
2. Don’t judge when others need assistance, this is a group project and we all share the same goal
3. Be realistic about expectations, don’t over commit yourself if you think you can’t come through on tasks
4. Try your best to not procrastinate
5. All work should be evenly divided between the group members.
6.  Stick to deadline as much as possible, if unable to due to unforeseen circumstances, let teammates know as early as possible


Things that you have experienced in groups that you DON’T want to happen: 
1. Not helping out other members when you have the chance
   1. Offer help if you think you have extra time to contribute
2. Cutting off communication
   1. Communicate and share updates regularly
3. Being codependent on others
   1. Commit to what you do, don’t be a stereotypical “person that waits on everyone else to get the work done”
   2. Also don’t be afraid to reach out to others for help
Finish this sentence: “I function best in groups when everyone focuses on the group goals rather than solely on individual tasks”
Finish this sentence: “I really hope our group can utilize our individual strengths to get the assignments done on time”
